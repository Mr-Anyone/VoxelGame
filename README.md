## Voxel Game From Scratch

Hello to whoever is reading this. I got board today and decided to make a voxel game pretty much from scratch.
Here are a list of features I may implement if I have time, because these are the ones that I've no idea how to implement! 
Features List:

- Block Delation
- Physics 

You have to understand that these are not easy things to implement. In fact, OpenGL is not straightforward.

## To Do List 

1. Faster Terrain Generation or the use of threading  (The game lags with terrain is trying to generate)
2. Texture mapping! Currently, there is only one type of block 
3. Make a height map somehow
